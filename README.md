# SoulRep Gym — Management Software

A professional-grade Gym Management System built with **Next.js 15**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL (Neon)**. Designed with a focus on modular backend architecture, type-safety, and AI-driven features.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

As a backend-focused project, the system follows a **Service-Oriented** architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

### 1. Domain-Based Service Layer
The business logic is decoupled from the API routes and isolated into dedicated domain services located in `src/backend/services/`:
*   **Nutrition Service**: Orchestrates AI-powered diet plan generation and macro calculations.
*   **Attendance Service**: Handles QR-based check-ins and session tracking.
*   **Booking Service**: Manages trainer schedules and PT session reservations.
*   **Review Service**: Processes trainer feedback and rating aggregation.
*   **Member Service**: Manages member profiles, security settings (password hashing), and physiological data synchronization.

### 2. Thin API Wrappers
Next.js API routes (`src/app/api/`) act as thin transport layers. They are responsible only for:
*   Route-level authentication via custom middleware.
*   Request validation and payload parsing.
*   Delegating execution to the appropriate domain service.

### 3. Database & Type Safety
*   **ORM**: Uses **Prisma** for type-safe database queries and automated migrations.
*   **Database**: Hosted on **Neon (PostgreSQL)**, utilizing serverless compute scaling.
*   **Schema**: A normalized relational schema documented via **DBML** (see `docs/database_schema.dbml`).

## 🤖 AI Features
Integrated with **Google Gemini Pro** to provide a personalized "AI Nutritionist" experience for gym members. The system takes into account:
*   Fitness goals (Muscle Gain, Fat Loss, etc.).
*   Activity levels and dietary preferences (Veg, Vegan, Non-Veg).
*   Automatic macro-target calculation based on physiological data.

## 📂 Project Structure
To maintain a "Clean Code" environment, all non-core assets are organized follows:
*   `/docs/`: Contains the database schema (DBML) and system diagrams (PlantUML).
*   `/scripts/`: Administrative utility scripts for data maintenance and migration.
*   `/src/backend/`: The heart of the application logic, containing services, shared Prisma clients, and server-side utilities.
